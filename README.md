Working on building a free user-friendly chat-bot using Java programming language to provide accessible technology education to children from rural communities. Designing interactive lessons introducing them to the basics of technology. Through this project, I am dedicated to creating an innovative solution that enables young learners to develop essential skills and a love for technology, inspiring them to consider technology careers for a brighter future in the field.
